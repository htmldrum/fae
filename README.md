# Fae - devise_saml_authenticable integration fork

This is a fork of the [Fae](https://github.com/wearefine/fae) project that maintains API compatibility with `devise_saml_authenticatable`, facilitating the use of AD identity providers that rely on SAML document exchange. Regularly pulling from the downstream, this fork maintains that the Fae::User model should not ship with database authentication by default and that the implementation constrains alternative authentication mechanisms.

If you desire this fork to be updated or modified, please submit GitHub issues (or emails to `htmldrum@tutanota.com`) and I'll promptly respond.
